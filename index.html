    <title>Welcome to HTML! This is a title, inside the "head" section</title>

  </head>

  <body>

    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>

    <p>
      This is a paragraph. Things in HTML are surrounded by tags. Similarily to
      markup, we can use these to easily write things into a prettier, formatted,
      and human readable format.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>We can also use <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> to make a line break (newline)</p>
    <p>
      Note here, that in the code we had to use HTML entities to display that
      code block because otherwise, it would count it as an actual line break tag.
    </p>

    <br>

    <b>We can write bold text,</b>
    <i>or italics,</i>
    <b><i>or a combination</i></b>

    <br>

    <cite>We can write citations</cite>

    <br>

    <a href="github.com/SWCTechClub">We can write links (this one goes to our club github)</a>

    <pre>
      <code>
        import time
        time.sleep(5)
        print("We can even include code blocks, just like in markdown")
      </code>
    </pre>

    <br>

    <p>
      We use the <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</code> tags in order to 
      make sure our code is formatted properly in the block. Code blocks can also
      be used inline like this.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>Lists can be made using a main list tag, and list item sub-tags</p>

    <ul>
      <li>An</li>
      <li>Unordered</li>
      <li>List</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>An</li>
      <li>Ordered</li>
      <li>List</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="color:blue">
      We can also create attributes inside paragraph sections with
      <code>&lt;p sytle="color:blue"&gt;</code>, like changing text
      color, or size and font, although this is usually done within CSS, which
      we will be learning later on.
